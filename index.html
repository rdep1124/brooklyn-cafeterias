         <p>As per New York law, health code violations in New York City schools are public information. When reporters investigated it, they found a high concentration of around 11% of the violations originate from one community board, #312, in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Why does this specific area in Brooklyn fail to meet health code standards with its varying types of schools, both public and private?</p>
